<h1>Description</h1>

This is a screenshot of my first Javascript project containing a password generator. The generator itself lets you input a password length from 8 to 128 characters, and also lets you pick if you want numbers, symbols, lowercase, and uppercase letters. It takes your input and gives you a randomized password with your specifications.
